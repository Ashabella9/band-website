          <h3>Christofer Drew</h3>
          <h4>Formed 2007</h4>
          <p>
            Singer-songwriter Christofer Drew started Never Shout Never as a
            one-man online project. It blossomed into a wildly popular major
            label emo band. <br />
            Drew launched Never Shout Never as a teen growing up in Missouri. At
            one point, the singer and musician averaged 15,000 online plays a
            day on various platforms. <br />
            He performed "Bigcitydreams"-off 2008's The Yipee EP-on MTV's TRL in
            2008. <br />
            Written and produced by Drew, Never Shout Never's 2009 single
            "Trouble" went gold in America. <br />
            After signing with Sire Records, Never Shout Never released the 2010
            mini-album What Is Love. It reached No. 2 on Billboard's Alternative
            Albums chart. <br />
            Drew returned later in 2010 with the full-length Harmony, produced
            by Butch Vig, the studio legend best known for his work on Nirvana's
            Nevermind. The album cracked the Top 20 of the Billboard 200. <br />
            By 2011's Time Travel, Never Shout Never had begun recording as a
            full band. The lineup featured drummer Caleb Denison, bassist Taylor
            MacFee, and guitarist Hayden Kaiser. <br />
            In 2019, Drew described the future of the group as uncertain
            following the departure of his bandmates. <br />
            Originally announced as a Christofer Drew solo effort, Unborn Spark
            arrived as a Never Shout Never album in 2020.
